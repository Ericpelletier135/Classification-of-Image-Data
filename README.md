# Classification-of-Image-Data
### Abstract
A key element in machine learning is the ability to predict outcomes with the highest accuracy possible.
In this project, we investigated the performance of a machine learning model —Multilayer Perceptron—
on a benchmark dataset —Fashion-MNIST —. During the experiments, we evaluated the effects that
difference number of hidden layers as well as difference activation functions had on our model’s accuracy.
In addition, we compared our model’s accuracy to a Convolutional Neural Network’s accuracy. In the
end, we found that the Multilayer Perceptron model reported a better accuracy with 2 hidden layers
compared to 1 or 0 hidden layers, and had the best accuracy using the relu activation function. Overall,
the Convolutional Neural Network reported better accuracy than the Multilayer Perceptron, which was
to be expected for image analysis.

This project was conducted in a group of 3 during the COMP 551 class at McGill University.
